# Image-colorization
It is my First ever project that I am publishing. The project will help anyone who want to colorise any black and white image.  It may give unbalanced color sometimes depending upon the image.


It a simple full web app created through

-HTML

-CSS

-Python

# Image Colorization

This is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to upload black and white images and get them colorized using a deep learning model.

## Features

- Upload black and white images.
- Colorize the uploaded images using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Download the colorized images.
- Easy to use interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Install the required Python packages:


3. Run the Flask application:


4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) to use the application.

## Usage

1. Click on the "Choose File" button to select a black and white image from your local machine.
2. Click on the "Upload" button to upload the selected image.
3. Once the image is uploaded, you will see a preview of the uploaded image.
4. Wait for the colorization process to complete.
5. Once colorization is done, you will see the colorized image.
6. Click on the "Save" button to download the colorized image to your local machine.

## Credits

- This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model for colorization. The model is based on the paper "Let there be Color!: Joint End-to-end Learning of Global and Local Image Priors for Automatic Image Colorization with Simultaneous Classification" by Zhang et al.
